## Star Tres 
![logo](/images/s3logo.png)

I’m a co-founder of the outreach initiative [Star Tres](http://www.startres.net/) together with Dr. Javiera Rey and Dr. Carolina Agurto. Since 2013, we work in create reliable astronomical material that we share in different social media platform ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/startres3/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Star_Tres), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/startrespics/), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1td3bBmNJoeCdIlYi7EjPG) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUdqLeQDRHCxMieLIdMf03g)) with the goal to share in simple words the most recent astronomical discoveries, but also show a more closer face of the scientific life. We are the first Chilean/spanish-speaking initiative of this type led by women, therefore, as part of our goal we promote the visibility of female participation in science. 

Nowadays our community is large (33000 subscribers in YouTube) which opened us up to many opportunities:

### Asteroid Workshop: A rocky Adventure, AVERO
![AVERO](/images/AVERO.png)
In 2020 we won a 5874EUR grant from the IAU-OAD outreach project. 

The goal of our project was to deliver astronomical material (900 kits) for students and develop a training course for teachers, focused on the science of asteroids:

- Many teachers in public schools, while they have motivation, they lack resources and training to implement any class-innovation beyond the basics.
- Selected students and teachers came from less favored Chilean public schools.
- Educational kits were built and distributed thanks to the OAD funding, with additional material from ALMA and ESO. 
- We trained all selected teachers so they could replicate the Asteroids Workshop with their students. Our asteroids handbook, workshop video, and all additional material was published in our website for other teachers to use it as well.


### Eclipse 2020 collaboration with SERNATUR Los Rios.

### Febrero de Cientificas
During all february 2019 and 2020, to promote women in science visibility we create the social media initiative [#FebreroDeCientificas](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/febrerodecient%C3%ADficas/), sharing short biographies of Latin American female scientists. Due to the big and positive response from our community, we are looking forward to continuing this in the next few years. 

### #YoutubersenALBA

## Public Talks at Universidad de Valparaiso 
During my years as student at Universidad de Valparaíso in Chile I participated in different outreach projects including astronomy talks in schools, general public, and in the organization of workshops for “Día Nacional de la Astronomía” and talks about woman and girls in science [“¿Qué significa ser científica hoy?”](https://parquecultural.cl/2018/02/11/conversatorio-dia-internacional-de-la-mujer-y-la-nina-en-la-ciencia/). I also collaborated with EXPLORA Valparaíso as scientific assistant in astronomy public events.
