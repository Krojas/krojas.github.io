  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <p><em>One of the biggest challenges in cosmology and astrophysics is to understand the parameters that describe the content, geometry, and evolution of our Universe. The gravitational lens effectâ€”produced by the deflection of light rays by a gravitational fieldâ€”is one of the most powerful tools to address these problems. It allows the study of dark matter, dark energy, and other fundamental components of the Universe.</em></p>

  <p><em>Iâ€™m presenting here some of the research topics of my interest, including the search for new gravitational lens systems using artificial intelligence.</em></p>

  <h3>Lens Finding</h3>

  <img src="/images/sim_selectbycnn0.png" alt="Simulations">

  <p>
    I am currently using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify gravitational lenses in ground-based imaging data. 
    This machine learning approach requires large training, validation, and test datasets composed of thousands of images. 
    However, with only a few hundred known strong lens systems available, synthetic data is necessary.
  </p>

  <p>
    To address this, I developed a comprehensive simulation pipeline using <em>Lenstronomy</em> (Birrer & Amara 2018) 
    to generate realistic simulations based on <strong>real observational data</strong>, unlike previous approaches relying solely on synthetic inputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next steps include observational follow-up campaigns using powerful telescopes to confirm our CNN-selected 
    candidates through high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy.

  <h3>Quasar Microlensing</h3>

  <img src="/images/micro.png" alt="Microlensing">

  <p>
    Quasar microlensing occurs when the light from a distant quasar is magnified by stars or compact objects in a foreground 
    galaxy, producing micro-arcsecond scale variations. I have worked on two primary applications in this area:
  </p>

  <h4>Inner Structure of Quasars</h4>

  <p>
    The central regions of quasars, including their accretion disks, are too small to be directly imaged, even with 
    interferometers like the VLTI. However, microlensing offers indirect access to this regime.
  </p>

  <p>
    By analyzing spectroscopic data for chromatic microlensing signatures (wavelength-dependent magnification), I have 
    been able to estimate the <strong>size</strong> and <strong>temperature profile</strong> of accretion disks, testing 
    models such as those proposed by Shakura & Sunyaev (1973).
  </p>

  <h4>Hubble Constant and Microlensing</h4>

  <p>
    Strongly lensed quasars can provide an <strong>independent measurement</strong> of the Hubble constant (H<sub>0</sub>) 
    through time-delay cosmography. Projects like <strong>COSMOGRAIL</strong> and <strong>H0LiCOW</strong> use long-term 
    photometric monitoring to extract these delays.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, microlensing-induced variations can bias these measurements. I studied and implemented methods proposed 
    by Tie & Kochanek (2018) to simulate and correct for <strong>microlensing time delay</strong>, ensuring more robust 
    estimates of H<sub>0</sub>. This methodology is now integrated into the H0LiCOW collaborationâ€™s workflow.
