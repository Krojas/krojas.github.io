##### I am a Chilean postdoctoral researcher and science communicator. I am currently working at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation of the University of Portsmouth.  I got my Ph.D. in astrophysics at Universidad de Valparaiso, Chile in 2018. I am an alumni of the program LSSTC Data Science fellowship (2nd cohort). My research is focused on the understanding of the Universe using the gravitational lensing effect. My current project started while I was working as a postdoc at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland and is focused on the search for new gravitational lens systems using artificial intelligence. The main idea is to learn how efficiently to search for these objects in available ground base data in preparation for the new avalanche of data that LSST and Euclid telescope will provide. Now we are also combining this with citizen science projects to have an idea about how much we can rely on automatic classification without human supervision.
